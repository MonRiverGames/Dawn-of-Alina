Thank you for buying my asset. In the asset there are two variants of animations: the root motion and in place.
 Animator is missing. In the demo scene, you can see animations such as root motion. In another scene, all objects are present. 
In case you want to cut such animations like sleeping, eating and drinking, here is the length of these animations:
- hide - 20 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- drink, eat, agression, sleep - 15 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
- lie - 35 frames at the beginning and end of the animation;
